# What is it?

`ggsupplyDemand` is a package that makes it extremely easy to plot supply and demand with `ggplot2`.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(ggsupplyDemand)

create_supply_and_demand() %>% 
  shift_demand(outwards = TRUE) %>% 
  plot_supply_and_demand(consumer_surplus = TRUE)
```

# Acknowledgment

`ggsupplyDemand` wouldn't exist without [Andrew Heiss](https://www.andrewheiss.com) from Brigham Young University and his [post](https://www.andrewheiss.com/blog/2017/09/15/create-supply-and-demand-economics-curves-with-ggplot2/) doing most of the heavylifting that `ggsupplyDemand` leverages. 

# Install it!

```{r eval=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, include=FALSE}
if (!require(devtools)) {
  install.packages("devtools")
}
devtools::install_github("David-Salazar/ggsupplyDemand")
```
